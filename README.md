# PHP-Snippets
 Simply a repository for any various PHP snippets I may put together from time to time and share here if and or whenever I may have free time to do so. Any snippets are shared "AS IS" simply as a basic starting point if desired to include said snippet(s) in various projects, then continue and improve upon said snippet(s) from there..
